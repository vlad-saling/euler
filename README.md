=====

[Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems) solved in sass.

Note: Some solution may have bash version to check, whether algorithm works in case it takes too long to compute in sass.

Notes:

7th problem take too much time to compute, so it has a JS version with same algorithm as a proof of concept.
